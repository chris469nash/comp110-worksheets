1)	The algorithm checks both list I and J and then will check whether I is equal to J and if list [i] is equal to [j]. If they are the same, the list contains a duplicate and will return as true. If there isn’t a duplicate, it will return as being false.
2)	Quadratic will have the slowest running time because it will quadruple the time required to run the script.
3)	.
4)	.
5)	.
6)	O (log in)
7)	O(n)
8)	The faster algorithm to run would be O (n log n) as O(n) is linear. This means that the function is proportional to the size of the list. O (n log n) will take only a few iterations as it halves the list whereas O (n) checks each item against each other. 
9)	The programmer may choose the “slower” algorithm because
